# Gene_Set_Enrichment_Pipeline
Pipeline used to test for an enrichment of sweeps in a set of genes while controlling for confounding factors and with the option to run a full False Postive Risk analysis (FPR or FDR, they are equivalent) by using block-randomized genomes. See the available manual.
You need to add ENSG to the start of you Gene IDs for the pipeline to work.
